Answer the following questions:

1. Discuss why the operator+= should return a reference to Fraction.

   We know that an operator whose result is an existing value, but modified (in our case is +=) should return
   a reference to the modified value. So, in order to avoid an unnecessary copy should there be operator chaining
   we return by reference.

2. List your uses of the pointer to the current object to simplify your code.

   I used pointer in += operator to return the current object after performing certien operation on it (the + operator).

3. Identify the temporary objects in the tester module.

   In the tester module Fraction a and Fraction c were temporary objects since no data was stored in Fraction.

4. Identify simplifications that you could make to your class without affecting the in-terface to the 
   client code.

   I can create separate function for my condition part in each operator and incorporate small function like min() and max() in the function
   that need them. In our case its gcd()

5. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

   I have learned the following things in this workshop:
  
   1) How to overload an operator as a member function ?
   2) From within a member function access the current object.
   3) Lifetime of the all the objects inculding the temporary ones as well.
