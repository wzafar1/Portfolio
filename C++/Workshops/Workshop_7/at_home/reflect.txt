Answer the following questions:
1. Why did we choose m_health to be a signed integer? (Hint: what happens if the Hero has a health of 1, 
   and someone does 2 points of damage to them.)

	We use m_health as a singed integer since we need to calculate the amount of damage applied to the
	Hero. The amount of health cannot be below zero so, when the Hero health is 1 and someone attack it
	with greater point of damage then the health it is stored as zero rather than negative value and 
	Hero is dead.


2. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the class SuperHero? 
   (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere in it?)
    How about the reverse, does SuperHero know about the Hero class?

	No, Hero class does not need to know the existence of SuperHero class but SuperHero class needs to
	know the existence of Hero class.

3. The program prints out “AncientBattle!” when 2 Heros fight. It prints out “SuperFight!” when 2 
    SuperHeros fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?

	It prints out "AncientBattle!"

4. True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 

	1) int main()
	{
  	Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero  ("Hector",    30, 5);
	}
		

	2) how about this?

	int main()
	{
	  ( Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero ("Hector",    30, 5) ) 
                              *
	  ( Hero ("Atalanta",  10, 3) * Hero ("Hippolyta", 10, 2) );
	}


	
	Yes, both are valid program definations. we get following output for each:

	1) Output:
		AncientBattle! Achilles vs Hector : Winner is Hector in 4 rounds.
	
	2) Output:
		AncientBattle! Atalanta vs Hippolyta : Winner is Atalanta in 4 rounds.
		AncientBattle! Achilles vs Hector : Winner is Hector in 4 rounds.
		AncientBattle! Hector vs Atalanta : Winner is Hector in 2 rounds.
