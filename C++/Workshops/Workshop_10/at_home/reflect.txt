Answer the following questions:

WORKSHOP QUESTIONS:

1- Name all different types of polymorphism with an example.

	There are four types of polymorphism:
	 1) Coercion.
		e.g.
			 void display(int a) {
     				cout << a << endl; 
					     }

			 int main( ) {
     				      display(10);
     				       display(12.6);
				      }

	 2) Overloading.
		e.g.	
			 void display() { cout << "Hello" << endl; }
			 void display(int a) {
     				cout << a << endl; 
					     }

			 int main( ) {
     				       display();
     				       display(12);
				      }
			
	 3) Inclusion.
		e.g.
			 #include <iostream>
 			#include "Course.h"
 			using std::cout;
 			using std::endl;

			 int main( ) {
    				        Course abc123("Intro to OO")
     					HybridCourse abc124("Intro to OO*");
   				        cout << abc123.assessments() << endl;
    					cout << abc123.mode() << endl;
    					cout << abc124.assessments() << endl; 
    					cout << abc124.mode() << endl;
					 }
	 4) Parametric.
		e.g.
 			template<typename T>
 			void sort(T* a, int n) {
   					  int i, j;
   					  T temp;

  					   for (i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  					       for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        					     if (a[j] > a[j+1]) {
              						   temp = a[j];
                					   a[j] = a[j+1];
                 					   a[j+1] = temp;
        					       }
        					     }
  						   }
 						}


 			int main( ) {
    				 int m[] = {189, 843, 321};
    				 Student s[] = {Student(1256), Student(1267), Student(1234)}; 

     				sort(m, 3);
				sort(s, 3);
     				for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
       					  cout << m[i] << endl;
    				for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        				 cout << s[i] << endl;
 				}

2- What category of polymorphism does a template fall?

	The template falls in parametric polymorphism.

3- What happens if a function template is never called?

	The program does not compiler, it gives compilation error.


SUBJECT SURVEY:

4- What was the most interesting thing you learned this semester?

	The most interesting thing that i learned was operator overloading and the use of string instead of char[].

5- Do you feel that the quizzes about the week’s readings helped you learn more than you might have 
   otherwise done.

	Yes, they helped me learn alot more than i might have learned otherwise.

6- Are there any things that you particularly like about the way that the course is delivered?

	The use of sample code other than the one privided in course material to explain different biult-in commands and the use of commands 
	other than the one specified in course material.

	No, Everthing in the course was perfect.

8- Is there anything you would like to see added to the way the course is delivered?

	No, the course was delivered perfectly.

a. Very good
b. Pretty good
c. Adequate
d. Poor

	Very good.
