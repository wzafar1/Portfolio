Please provide brief answers to the following questions:

1) What is the advantage of passing values from a function through its parameters rather than through 
   its return value?  

	Following are the advantages of passing value from a function through its parameters:
	 1) It allows management of structures which are allocated memory dynamically
	 2) We can return multiple values to the main function.
	 3) It makes possible to pass address of structure instead of entire structure to the functions.
	

2) Explain the meaning of the term dereference and identify an example in your code. 

	The * operator is called the dereferencing. This operator is applied to a pointer's identifier that
	evaluates to the value in the address that that pointer holds. We used the dereference in decompose 
	function where we sent the address of the of the variables using pointers.

3) Explain what is stored in a pointer variable.  

	 A variable that holds an address is called a pointer. To store the a variable's address, 
	 we define a pointer of the variable's type and assign the variable's address to that pointer
