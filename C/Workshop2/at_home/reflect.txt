   By completing the workshop, I learned the following things:


1) Proper way to use Specifier for User Input in scanf() statement and for displaying the output on screen in printf() statement.
   	For example, for input of Double data type we use %lf and for int data type we use %d.

2) How to combine and use binary operator with operand to achieve the required result. 
   	For example, calculating the number of Dimes or Nickel required after certain deduction.

3) How to use casting to convert from one data type to another. 
	For example, change a variable to int from double or float.

4) Displaying the result in a desired format on screen by using Escape Sequence like \n. 
	For example:

	printf("I LOVE C PROGRAMING \n”);
	printf("BUT I ALSO LOVE OTHER PROGRAMING LANGUAGES ");

	It will display on screen as fellow:

	I LOVE C PROGRAMING
	BUT I ALSO LOVE OTHER PROGRAMING LANGUAGES
