Please provide brief answers to the following questions:

1) What are the possible return values of the function readRecord? What does this return value represent?
	
	The readRecord reads the content of the text file and return 1 first time, if used in a loop the value
	goes up to 5 indicating the number of total record read each time the function is called. Each line
	before newline is treated as a 1 record. the return value represent total number of record read.

2) What is the difference between opening a file in r, w, and a+ mode?
	
	Following are the differences between each mode:
	
	 1) r
		The mode allows the user to read the file content but does not allow to add or remove
		the existing record
	2) w
		The mode allows the user to write new record to the file but it should be remembered that 
		it will overwrite the old recod with new record.
	3) a+
		This mode open the file for writing and also for reading. This mode doesnot overwrite the
		old record but add to the end of current record.
