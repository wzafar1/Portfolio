Please provide brief answers to the following questions:

1) What is a function and briefly discuss the need for functions in any language?.

	A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), 
	and all the programs can define additional functions.
	You can divide up your code into separate functions. Following are the advantages of dividing the code in separate functions:
		1) This makes modifying each code easy.
		2) It helps in finding the error in the program rather them going into the entire code. For example: logical error.

2) Comment on the modularity and reusability of addPositive and subtractPositive functions.
	
	The addPositive and substractPositive function makes it easy for us to use their code anywhere in the program (main function). By 
	separating a specific piece of code from the main function and putting them into another function save us alot of time of retyping the
	same code again in different parts of the program. Wile these functions being modular we can easily modify their code without distruping
	the main function.

3) How do you send and receive data back to and from functions? 
	
	We send the data by calling the function and providing it with the inputsvariabels that store the data. Then the fuctions calculate 
	the result and send the result back. For this purpose we use return command followed by the variable which stores the result or 
	the result itself. The function store the data to assigned variable which it is assigned or we can simply use it in printf statement.
