Provide beirf answers to the following questions:

1) Why do the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?
   
   We declare the array to hold 10 elements because each element of the array is used to store 1 value (for each day)
   like the array temp_l[10] will store ten low values and temp_h[10] will store ten high values. Since we are also told at
   the start of the program that we have to store temperature for 3 to 10 days.

2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?
   
   Advantages:
	The main advantage of using matching array is that programmer can easily identify the array storing similar type of data like temperature.
   Disadvantage:
	The disadvantage of using matching array is that sometime the number of elements is greater or less in one array then the matching array despite 
	having similar data type.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 

   The home portion of this workshop was too easy. The main reason for that is this workshop is similar to the perviuos workshop. The only
   difference is that we have to use array instead on different variable to store the temperature. So, by doing little tweaking to the
   pervious code we can easily do this worshop.
