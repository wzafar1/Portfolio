Please provide brief answers to the following questions:

1) Discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data.
		Array of structs
	1. It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
	2. It can be used to implement other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc. 
		Parallel Array
	1. Parallel arrays are harder to manage; each time you add another field you have to add another array.
	   If you want to pass 'the entity as a whole' to another function, you have to pull out all the items.
	2. Parallel arrays that aren't just acting as raw storage. Want to swap two 'elements'? 
	   Whoops, you have to swap all the array pairs individually.

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why.
	
	The main reason for declaring a Struct data type in a header file is that it helps us specifing the compiler what type of data type
	it is dealing with in the program. It aslo helps us call the sturct in other funstion not only the main function.
