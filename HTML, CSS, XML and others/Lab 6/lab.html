						 Justin Pierre James Trudeau PC MP (born December 25, 1971) is a Canadian politician. He is the 23rd and current Prime Minister of Canada and leader of the 
						 Liberal Party.[1][2] The second youngest prime minister after Joe Clark, he is also, as the eldest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the first 
						 to be related to a previous holder of the post.[3][4]
						 Born in Ottawa, Trudeau attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and graduated from McGill University in 1994 and the University of British Columbia in 1998. He 
						 gained a high public profile in October 2000, when he delivered a eulogy at his father's state funeral.[5] After graduating, he worked as a teacher in 
						 Vancouver, British Columbia. He completed one year of an engineering program at Montreal's École Polytechnique before quitting in 2003. In 2005 he began 
						 a master's degree in environmental geography at McGill University but quit after one year. He used his public profile to advocate for various causes and 
						 acted in the 2007 TV miniseries The Great War.[6]
						 Eight years after his father's death, Trudeau entered politics. In the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of Papineau in the 
						 House of Commons. In 2009, he was appointed the Liberal Party's critic for youth and multiculturalism, and the following year, became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as critic for secondary education and youth and amateur sport. Trudeau won the leadership of the Liberal Party in April 2013 and went on to lead his party to victory in the 2015 federal election, moving the 3rd-placed Liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a Canadian election.
						 Canadian Politician: 
						 After years of avoiding the political arena, Trudeau stepped into the fray in 2006 by chairing the Liberal Party's 
						 task force on youth renewal. The following year, Trudeau began his campaign for a Parliament seat representing Montreal's Papineau riding,
						 or district, winning the post in 2008. He also appeared as legendary soldier Talbot Papineau in the historical TV movie The Great War in 2007. 
						 In addition to having acting skills, Trudeau showed himself to be a skilled boxer in 2012. He had sparred with his father growing up, and that 
						 practice paid off when he defeated conservative senator Patrick Brazeau in a charity boxing match. The charismatic, young Trudeau also proved to 
						 be a rising political force, becoming the Liberal Party's leader in 2013. Two years later, Trudeau sought Canada's highest office. He promised 
						 Canadian voters "real change" in his campaign, calling for tax increases for the wealthy and tax cuts for the middle class. He also pledged to 
						 protect abortion rights and push through the legalization of marijuana in Canada. A committed environmentalist, Trudeau also stated that he would 
						 work on the country's climate change policies. His positive campaign stood in sharp contrast to his opponent Stephen Harper's re-election efforts, 
						 which included numerous attack ads on Trudeau. Trudeau led his party to a remarkable victory in October 2015, which won the majority in Parliament,
						 going from 36 seats to 184 seats — the largest increase in the country's history. He unseated Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper, who had served 
						 as prime minister since 2006. In his victory speech, Trudeau said, according to the National Post, "Canadians have spoken. You want a government with a
						 vision and an agenda for this country that is positive and ambitious and hopeful... I promise you tonight that I will lead that government." At 43 years 
						 old, Trudeau was the second youngest person to become prime minister of Canada — (the first being Joe Clark who had been sworn in as PM a day before his 
						 40th birthday in 1979). Trudeau is also notable for being the first verified PM with non-European roots, his sixth great grandmother being of Malays descent.
						 In November 2015 Trudeau made headlines when he appointed half of his cabinet positions to women, honoring a campaign promise of having a gender-balanced 
						 cabinet. When asked why he felt the need to do this, the self-purported "proud feminist" simply replied: "Because it's 2015."
